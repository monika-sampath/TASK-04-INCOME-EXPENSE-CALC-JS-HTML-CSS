DESCRIPTION :

I have Created a fully functional Income Expense Calculator using HTML, TAILWINDCSS, and JavaScript. This project will allow the users to add, edit, and delete income and expense entries, providing an overview of their financial status. The project will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage the data.

step - 1 :Created a clean and intuitive layout using HTML/TAILWINDCSS and JS.
step - 2 :Included input fields for entering income and expense details (e.g., description, amount) and type radio buttons.
step - 3 :created a mockAPI to do get,put and delete methods
step - 4 :Included 3 filters [ “all”, “income”, “expense” ] to get only the needed data. (use radio buttons)
step - 5 :Display a list of all entries with options to edit or delete each one.
step - 6 :Displayed the total income, total expenses, and net balance at the top using functions.

Added local storage functionality to persist data across sessions.
Clean, well-documented code for HTML, TAILWINDCSS, and JavaScript is written.
A responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

i have used async functions with try and catch method to achieve the actions like edit,delete and add data.


WORKING METHOD:

user can use edit option to rewrite the data entered early
